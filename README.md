# Developing Autonomous Agents in Practice with LangChain

This repository contains the code and resources for the "Developing Autonomous Agents in Practice with LangChain" workshop, part of the WOA 2025 event. 

In this lesson, we will explore the fundamental principles of building applications with Large Language Models (LLMs) using LangChain. Participants will gain hands-on experience in developing LLM-powered solutions, integrating LLMs with external tools and data sources, and designing autonomous agents capable of performing tasks independently.

This repository works both as slides and as a code repository. The slides are available in the `presentation.ipynb` file, which can be opened in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment. 

The slides are generated via `nbconvert`, and the code is organized in a way that allows you to follow along with the examples presented in the slides.
